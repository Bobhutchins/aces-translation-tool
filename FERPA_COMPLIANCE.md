## ACES Translation Tool - FERPA Compliance Measures

### Overview

The ACES Translation Tool is designed to be fully compliant with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations. This document outlines the specific measures implemented to ensure student data privacy and security.

### FERPA Compliance Features

#### 1. Data Encryption
- **In Transit**: All data transmission uses HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **At Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms
- **Database**: All stored data is encrypted with AES-256 encryption

#### 2. Access Controls
- **Role-Based Access**: Users are assigned specific roles (admin, translator, reviewer) with appropriate permissions
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- **Session Management**: Configurable session timeouts and automatic logout
- **Audit Logging**: All user actions are logged for compliance monitoring

#### 3. Data Handling
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only necessary information is collected and processed
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files and old data
- **Secure File Storage**: Uploaded documents are stored in secure, access-controlled directories
- **Data Anonymization**: Personal identifiers are handled according to FERPA guidelines

#### 4. User Management
- **Staff Authentication**: Only authorized ACES staff can access the system
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and optional two-factor authentication
- **Account Management**: Secure user account creation, modification, and deletion
- **Access Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of user access and activities

#### 5. Document Processing
- **Secure Upload**: Documents are uploaded through encrypted channels
- **Temporary Processing**: Documents are processed in secure, temporary locations
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Processed files are automatically deleted after translation completion
- **No Permanent Storage**: Original documents are not permanently stored unless explicitly required

#### 6. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse and unauthorized access
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-origin requests are properly configured

### Technical Implementation

#### Security Headers
```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
}));
```

#### Data Encryption
- All sensitive data is encrypted using bcrypt for passwords
- JWT tokens are signed with secure secrets
- File uploads are validated and sanitized

#### Audit Logging
```javascript
// All user actions are logged
securityLogger.translationRequest(userId, sourceLang, targetLang, wordCount, ip);
securityLogger.fileUpload(userId, fileName, fileSize, ip);
securityLogger.loginAttempt(email, success, ip);
```

### Compliance Checklist

- ✅ **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- ✅ **Access Controls**: Role-based access with proper authentication
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all user activities
- ✅ **Secure File Handling**: Secure upload, processing, and cleanup
- ✅ **User Management**: Secure user account management
- ✅ **API Security**: Protected endpoints with rate limiting
- ✅ **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of temporary data
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without data exposure

### Data Flow Security

1. **Document Upload**
   - Files are validated for type and size
   - Uploaded to secure, temporary directory
   - Access is restricted to authorized users only

2. **Translation Processing**
   - Documents are processed in memory when possible
   - Temporary files are created in secure locations
   - Processing logs are maintained for audit purposes

3. **Translation Storage**
   - Translations are stored with proper access controls
   - Original documents are not permanently stored
   - All data is encrypted at rest

4. **Data Cleanup**
   - Temporary files are automatically deleted
   - Old translations are archived or deleted per policy
   - Audit logs are maintained for compliance

### Staff Training Requirements

All ACES staff using the translation tool must:

1. **Complete FERPA Training**: Annual FERPA compliance training
2. **Understand Data Handling**: Proper handling of student information
3. **Follow Security Protocols**: Adherence to security best practices
4. **Report Incidents**: Immediate reporting of any security incidents
5. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Strict confidentiality of student data

### Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Stop the affected service
2. **Assessment**: Determine the scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Notify appropriate authorities and affected parties
4. **Documentation**: Document all actions taken
5. **Recovery**: Restore services with enhanced security measures

### Regular Compliance Reviews

- **Monthly**: Security log reviews
- **Quarterly**: Access control audits
- **Annually**: Full FERPA compliance assessment
- **As Needed**: Security updates and patches
