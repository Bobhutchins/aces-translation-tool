2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aces-translation-tool.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

   - Sign up/login with GitHub

2. **Create New Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your `aces-translation-tool` repository

3. **Configure Backend:**
   - Railway will auto-detect it's a Node.js project
   - Set the **Root Directory** to: `server`
   - Add these environment variables:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     PORT=5001
     NODE_ENV=production
     ```

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel:**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up/login with GitHub

2. **Import Project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `aces-translation-tool` repository

3. **Configure Frontend:**
   - **Framework Preset:** Create React App
   - **Root Directory:** `client`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues:
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify your Anthropic API key is correct
- Ensure environment variables are set

### Frontend Issues:
- Check Vercel build logs
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to your Railway backend
- Check browser console for errors

### Translation Issues:
- Verify API key has credits
- Check Railway logs for API errors
- Test with a simple text file first

## üì± Mobile Testing

Your deployed app works on mobile devices! Share the Vercel URL and test on phones/tablets.

## üîí Security Notes

- This is a demo with hardcoded credentials
